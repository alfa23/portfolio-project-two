# UCD Phase 1: STRATEGY 

## PROJECT GOALS

![Initial Project Doodlings](readme_media)

## External User Goals: 

- 
- 
- Ability to contact 

  Additional ***user expectations*** for consideration include:
  - Intuitive/conventional navigation elements
  - Familiar and/or easily understandable site structure
  - Responsive: access site easily on any device

## Site Owner Goals:

- Establish a simple-yet-stylish test for nerdiness
- Ability to 
- Opportunity for other nerdy types to make contact & offer feedback 
  
  Additional ***stakeholder concerns*** for consideration: 
  - Geeky, retro feel with some animated element(s) preferred; page background/icons/logo
  - Multiple themed galleries rather than all-artworks-in-one
  - Potential for future expansion of question base 


## Potential Features:

Considering the goals, expectations and concerns detailed above, potential features for the **nerdOmeter** site should include:
- A stylish and effective design with easy, intuitive navigation - and some animation!
- A prominent contact methods; feedback form
- Potential for a Rankings or Leaderboard feature

---- 

# UCD Phase 2: SCOPE

### Analysis and grading of *Phase One considerations* allows a simple ***Strategy Table*** to be generated:


| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE | IMPORTANCE | VIABILITY/FEASIBILITY | ID    | 
|-----------------------------|:----------:|:---------------------:|:-------
| Stylish website             | 5          | 5                     | A     |
| Multiple artwork galleries  | 5          | 4                     | B     |
| Prominent contact options   | 5          | 5                     | C     |
| 'About' artist info         | 5          | 5                     | D     |
| E-commerce elements         | 3          | 1                     | E     |
| TOTAL                       | 23         | 20                    |       |


![UCD Strategic Trade-Offs: Importance vs Feasibility](readme_media)

## Strategic Trade-offs

Plotting the Strategy Table results provides a visible indication of what is feasibily within the scope of the project at this time. As I am unable to meet all requirements at present, I will aim to provide RJW Illustration initially as an MVP or Minimum Viable Product, therefore: 
  Due to time and current-skill limitations (and to also remain close to the number of pages required for this project) the site will be delivered in phases.

  ***Initial Phase:*** Delivery of MVP, a fully functioning website, with the exception of
    
  - E-commerce features/preparations. As a low stakeholder priority, this will follow at a later date as required (and skill levels increase!)
  
  - Initial gallery count of two. Sufficient for proof of concept, subsequent galleries will be added in sunsequent phases.

# UCD Phase 3: STRUCTURE

## **nerdOmeter** Layout 

Maps generated in [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com) 

Prior to generating my wireframes in Balsamiq, I used it's handy Site Map element to better visualise the basic structure and navigation between proposed site pages. 

As with all good wireframes, they are only a guide and subject to change! Amalgamation of pages (following Project Planning session advice from my Mentor - thanks, Marcel!) and project phasing resulted in the final site layout below.

# UCD Phase 4: SKELETON

## Initial Wireframes for **nerdOmeter**

Following current conventional practice, **nerdOmeter** was designed with a Mobile First approach.

All wireframes generated in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)

# UCD Phase 5: SURFACE

## DESIGN CHOICES

## Fonts

All fonts utilised in this project were sourced from and served by [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com)
- **Heading Font:** *Press Start 2P*
  
  *Press Start P2* is a cursive style font with a retro-tech, pixellated appearance. It was chosen as it effectively conveys the nerdy aesthetic of both site focus and content.

- **Body Font:** *VT323*

  The monotype font *VT323* was chosen as a geeky, computer-themed compliment to *Press Start P2*.

![Google Fonts Choices](readme_media/site_screens/pp02_googlefonts.png)

## Colours

- **#000000** *colour name*

  Colours were chosen from the palette of the background video.


## Imagery

### All icons utilised in **nerdOmeter** are credited within the site, via the modal link in the footer, in addition to a summary available

## FEATURES

## Site-wide Features

- **Site-wide Header with Logo and Dynamic Subheader**

![Site-wide Logo & Subheader](readme_media)

  - Visually balancing the top-left-aligned nav elements, the RJW Illustration logo is rendered top-right using Amatic SC, a cursive web font in a simple, hand-drawn style.
  - Featured on all website pages, the fully responsive header includes links to the Home page, Portfolio landing page and Contact page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.
    - This allows the user to consistently navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
  - The example below shows an underline in the site's chosen accent colour, Chartreuse, indicating the current **active** page.

- **Site-wide Animated Page Background**

  - The main Home page section consists of an original animated (.mp4) background created by RJW 
    - RJW intends to regularly update the background with fresh animations, encouraging visitors to return and check for new work playing
  - Pages containing copy have been styled with a dark tinted panel behind to reduce contrast between the white copy and underlying animation, this assists users by enhancing contrast and legibility 
  
![Neontrack mp4](readme_media)


- **Site-wide Footer** 

  - The footer section includes links to Instagram and Behance external sites and will open to a new tab, allowing easy navigation for the user. This is valuable to site users as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.
  - Additional site-wide breadcrumb-style nav links included in the footer allow easy user navigation to Home, Portfolio and Contact pages at the bottom of long gallery pages and pages on smaller, responsive-styled screens.

![Site-wide Footer](readme_media)

![Site-wide Footer Modal](readme_media)

## Home Page Features

- The Home page consists of two responsive elements:
  - ***Left [responsive: top]*** comprises of an 'About' heading above text on dark-tinted panel, containing brief information about RJW, encouraging getting in touch and thanking for visiting. Valuable to user relations as it conveys pertinent information in a friendly, approachable manner
  - ***Right [responsive: bottom]*** a paused and muted time-lapse video of RJW's digital art process for the 'Dizzy' illustration. Valuable to users as it provides an insight into RJW's methods and artistic process. 
    - In the interest of good UXD, THE VIDEO DOES NOT AUTOPLAY until user-invoked, looping thereafter until stopped

# VERSION CONTROL

Managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** via regular commits pushed to GitHub remote servers:

## Gitpod Workspaces
1. Starting from GitHub, clone the Code Institute template by clicking Use This Template and copying to my repo. Launch Workspace by clicking GitPod button - this action is only performed once and the workspace is subsequently reopened through GitPod.

2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an online IDE editor window.
    
    - Update GitHub by committing from GitPod

3. During editing save the code regularly, using git add ., git commit -m "commit message here" and git push Bash commands to push changes to the GitHub repository.

4. Meaningful commit messages allow easy roll-back of any changes to earlier versions.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

## jshint Validator Testing 

- JavaScript
  - No errors were returned when passing through the [JSHint validator](https://jshint.com/)

![JSHint JS](readme_media)

## W3C Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org)

**Google Developer Tools**

- I made use of the built-in **Chrome Dev Tools** to experiment and debug while coding, in addition to testing simulated responsive behaviour across a wide range of mobile and desktop devices, and finally checking all pages Performance using **Lighthouse**. 


**Response Testing**

In order to make sure that RJW Illustration was responsive to all device sizes, I used [amiresponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

**WebPageTest**

- I used [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) set to London/Chrome as a final test for **nerdOmeter**.

    - Both Gallery pages were initally flagged for uncompressed images, which resulted in a second image overhaul, where I re-optimised, replaced and re-linked all .jpeg images with smaller fresh versions!
